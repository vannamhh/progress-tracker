# Progress Tracker

Progress Tracker is an Obsidian plugin that visualizes your task completion progress and helps you stay on top of your work.

2. Disable Safe mode
3. Click "Browse" and search for "Progress Tracker"
4. Install the plugin and enable it

## Requirements

- [Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) (optional but recommended)

## Configuration

### General Settings
- Toggle debug information
- Customize update animations

### Performance
- Adjust the delay for various operations to balance responsiveness and performance
- Configure keyboard input and checkbox click update delays

### Progress Bar Colors
- Choose from preset color schemes or create your own
- Customize thresholds for low/medium/high progress states

### Metadata Auto-Update

- Change status fields and add completion dates
- Customize status labels

### Kanban Integration
- Automatically move cards in Kanban boards based on task status
- Match column names to status values

## Usage Tips

### Task Format
The plugin recognizes standard Markdown task formats:

- [] Incomplete task
- [x] Completed task


### YAML Frontmatter
For status tracking, use YAML frontmatter at the top of your notes:
```yaml
---
status: In Progress
---
```

The plugin will automatically update this to "Completed" when all tasks are done.

Kanban Integration
For the best Kanban integration:

- Name your columns to match your status labels (Todo, In Progress, Completed)
- Enable automatic synchronization in settings

### Keyboard Shortcuts
You can assign keyboard shortcuts to the following commands:

- Clear completed files cache - Reset the list of files that have already triggered completion notifications

## Troubleshooting
- Progress bar not updating: Check that your tasks use the proper Markdown format
- Kanban integration not working: Ensure your Kanban columns match your status values
- Slow updates: Adjust the performance settings to balance responsiveness with performance
